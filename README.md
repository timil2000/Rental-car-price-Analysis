# Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This project showcases the implementation of various advanced data structures and algorithms to solve multiple tasks efficiently. Below is a summary of the key components and features included in this project.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Boyer-Moore Algorithm**: Utilized for efficient frequency counting of words in text files.
- **Edit Distance Algorithm**: Applied for spelling corrections and generating word suggestions.
- **Merge Sort**: Used for sorting suggestions in the spell checker.
- **Quick Sort**: Implemented for sorting products by ratings in descending order.

## Key Tasks Performed

### Web Crawling with Selenium
Implemented web crawling using Selenium, including handling pop-ups and browser control.

### URL Extraction
A Java program that reads from CSV files to extract URLs from text.

### Search Frequency Tracker
Implemented using self-balancing trees like AVL tree and red-black tree.

### Spell Checker
- Utilized a Cuckoo Hash Table for fast lookups.
- Integrated an Edit Distance Algorithm for spelling corrections.
- Applied Merge Sort for sorting word suggestions.

### Input Processing
Added a reusable function to process user input, ensuring it does not contain special characters and validating it appropriately.

### Display Top Items
Displayed the top 10 items from the `PageRanking` class below spelling suggestions in the `IntegratedFinalFile` class.

### Product Sorting
- Enabled sorting of products by ratings in descending order using Quick Sort.
- Allowed users to view the full available list of products.

### Car Rental Price Analysis
Implemented data structures and algorithms to analyze car rental prices.

### Inverted Indexing
Developed an inverted indexing system in the `IntegratedFinalFile` Java class for efficient search operations.
